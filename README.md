# AI-DECISION-MAKING-FOR-OPTIMZING-AGRICULTURAL-PRODUCTIVITY
## Overview
This project leverages AI-driven decision-making to optimize agricultural productivity by providing farmers with intelligent recommendations. The system includes a **Crop Recommender System**, a **Fertilizer Analysis System**, and an **AI-powered Disease Detection System**, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to enhance yield and sustainability.

## Features
### 1. Crop Recommender System
- Suggests the best crops based on soil quality, weather conditions, and past yield data.
- Utilizes machine learning models trained on agricultural datasets.
- Factors in market demand and profitability for optimal selection.

### 2. Fertilizer Analysis System
- Analyzes soil nutrient composition to recommend the appropriate type and quantity of fertilizers.
- Uses AI algorithms to optimize fertilizer application for cost-effectiveness and sustainability.
- Reduces overuse of chemical fertilizers, promoting eco-friendly farming.

### 3. AI-powered Disease Detection System
- Uses deep learning models to identify plant diseases from images.
- Provides early warnings to farmers for effective disease management.
- Suggests remedial actions based on detected diseases.
